## Gaps Identified

1. Missing Test Areas:
   [] Dashboard functionality tests
   [] Competitor management tests
   [] Notes system integration tests
   [] Performance testing
   [] Cross-browser compatibility

2. Needed Additional Coverage:
   [] Error handling scenarios
   [] Edge cases
   [] Load testing
   [] Security testing

## Next Steps

1. Implement missing test coverage:
   [] Create dashboard test suite
   [] Add competitor management tests
   [] Develop notes system tests

2. Enhance existing tests:
   [] Add error scenarios
   [] Include edge cases
   [] Add performance metrics

3. Setup automated testing:
   [] Configure CI pipeline
   [] Add test reporting
   [] Set up coverage tracking
